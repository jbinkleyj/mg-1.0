	MG Information Retrieval System
	===============================

This system is described in the book ``Managing Gigabytes:
Compressing and Indexing Documents and Images'', I.H. Witten,
A. Moffat, and T.C. Bell; Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York,
1994; ISBN 0-442-01863-0; US$54.95; call 1 (800) 544-0550 to
order.  A tutorial guide to the MG system appears an an 
appendix.


The files in this directory are:

mg.tar.Z
	A tarred, compressed, collection of C and other source
	files.  Use

		uncompress < mg.tar.Z | tar xf -

	to create a new directory ./mg-1.0 that contains the
	distribution.  This directory contains its own README 
	file, you should read it next.

	The current version is mg-1.0, dated 25 March 1994.

mg.tar.gz
	The same, except gnuzip is used as the compression agent.
	Use

		gunzip < mg.tar.gz | tar xf -

	to unpack it.

MG.book.errata
	A text file listing known errors in the book.
	(Currently just the LaTeX source of the next file)

MG.book.errata.ps
	The same, but as a formatted postscript file. 

README
	This file.


See the file ./mg-1.0/INSTALL (after unpacking the archive)
for information about installation and system availability.


There is one important feature of MG not described in the MG
book.  Since completing the book we have developed an X
interface.  A brief description appears in the ``Appendix''
section of MG.book.errata. More detailed guidance can be
obtained by unpacking and installing the distribution and then
typing ``man xmg''.
