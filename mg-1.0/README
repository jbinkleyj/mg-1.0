 
                     MG INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM
                     ===============================
 
The MG system is a suite of programs for compressing and
indexing text and images. Most of the functionality implemented
in the suite is as described in the book ``Managing Gigabytes:
Compressing and Indexing Documents and Images'', I.H. Witten, A.
Moffat, and T.C. Bell; Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York, 1994, ISBN
0-442-01863-0; US $54.95; call 1 (800) 544-0550 to order.
 
These features include:
 
-- text compression using a Huffman-coded semi-static word-based
   scheme
-- two-level context-based compression of bi-level images
-- FELICS lossless compression of gray-scale images
-- combined lossy/lossless compression for textual images
-- indexing algorithms for large volumes of text in limited main
   memory
-- index compression
-- a retrieval system that processes Boolean and ranked queries
-- an X windows interface to the retrieval system
 
As one example, a collection of 2 Gb of text (1,700,000
documents) can be indexed (on a SPARC 10 Model 512) in about
four hours and compressed in a further four hours to make a
database that in total occupies less than 800 Mb, or 40% of the
original size. This includes a full index to every word and
number in the original text. Boolean queries such as ``managing
AND gigabytes'' run in a few seconds, and ranked queries of
30--50 terms are evaluated in 10--30 seconds.
 
Details of these methods and further performance results
may be found in the MG book.
 
The MG system comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details see
the file COPYING.

** CHANGES
 
For copyright reasons the stemmer used in this distribution of
MG is not the same as the one illustrated Figure 3.8 on page 108
of the MG book.  The stemmer here is a simple stopgap, pending
the implementation of a new one.  This means that the numbers
generated by the command ``mgstat alice'' will not match those
numbers in Figure A.1 on page 394.
 
The output format of ``mgstat'' has changed since Figure A.1
(page 394) was prepared. The same information is displayed but
formatted differently.
