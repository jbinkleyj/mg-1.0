@.TH mg_invf_dump 1 "15 May 1994"
.SH NAME
mg_invf_dump \- Dump out an inverted file in ASCII
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mg_invf_dump
[
.B \-h

[
.B \-b

[
.B \-w
]
[
.BI \-d " directory"
]
.BI \-f " name"
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program dumps out an inverted file produced by the
.BR mg (1)
system as ASCII numbers.  This program could be used in conjunction
with
.BR mgdictlist (1)
to write simple shell programs that work with the inverted files.  The
output from the program looks something like this:
.LP
.RS
.ft 3

.RE
The first number (6) is the number of documents in the collection.  It
is followed by the number of different terms in the collection.  For
each term, the number of different documents it occurs in follows. The
document numbers that the term occurs in are listed next.  If
.B \-w
is specified, then the number of times the term occurred in the
document is printed alongside the document number.
.SH OPTIONS
Options may appear in any order.
.TP "\w'\fB\-d\fP \fIdirectory\fP'u+2n"
.B \-h
This displays a usage line on
.IR stdout .
.TP
.B \-b
This option will cause the output from the program to be in fixed-size
binary numbers, rather than in ASCII.
.TP
.B \-w
If the inverted file is a level-2 or level-3 inverted file, this causes
the word counts per document to be output.
.TP
.BI \-d " directory"
This specifies the directory where the document collection can be found.
.TP
.BI \-f " name"
This specifies the base name of the document collection.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP "\w'\fBMGDATA\fP'u+2n"
.SB MGDATA
If this environment variable exists, then its value is used as the
default directory where the
.BR mg (1)
collection files are.  If this variable does not exist, then the
directory \*(lq\fB.\fP\*(rq is used by default.  The command line
option
.BI \-d " directory"
overrides the directory in
.BR MGDATA .
.SH FILES
.TP 20
.B *.invf.dict
The compressed stemmed dictionary.
.TP
.B *.invf.ORG
The original inverted file saved by
.BR mg_invf_rebuild .
.TP
.B *.invf
The inverted file.

This program dumps out an inverted file produced by the MG system as ASCII numbers. This program could be used in conjunction with

to write simple shell programs that work with the inverted files. The output from the program looks something like this :

The First number (6) is the number of documents in the collection, it is followed by the number of different terms in the collection. For each term, the number of different documents it occurs in is next, The document numbers that the term occurs in are listed next. If 
d49 2
a50 1
is specified then the number of times the term occurred in the document is printed along side the document number.

then the directory \*(lq\fB.\fP\*(rq is used by default. The command line
