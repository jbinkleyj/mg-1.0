This file records changes to the mg man pages.

(0) Write new mg.1 file to give a brief overview of mg, with samples
of how to use it.  Otherwise, users are likely to be completely
overwhelmed by the number of programs (about 20) which might need to
be used, when in reality, only 2 or 3 are likely to be run by end
users.

(1) The mg_make_fast_dict.1 file has been renamed mg_fast_comp_dict.1,
and all mg_make_fast_dict strings changed to mg_fast_comp_dict in all
man pages.

(2) A large number of errors of spelling, typography, spacing, fonts,
grammar, omitted words, slang, punctuation, missing man page
cross-references, and man-page style have been corrected.

(3) Of those programs that support a -h option to give a short help
message, roughly half write it to stderr, and half to stdout.  All
references to "on the screen" in -h descriptions have been changed to
indicate either stderr or stdout.  However, this is definitely a
consistency problem that should be fixed at source level.  I believe
that all of these programs should write such messages to stderr.

(4) Recommendation: mqguery (and others) should be revised to permit
values like 4K and 2M to be given in place of awkward numbers like
4096 and 2097152.

(5) Code in mgstat is not checking for a zero divisor:

% ls
bibfiles.invf               bibfiles.text.idx.wgt
bibfiles.invf.dict.blocked  bibfiles.trace
bibfiles.text               bibfiles.weight.approx
bibfiles.text.dict.fast

% mgstat bibfiles
Unable to open "./bibfiles.text.dict"
Unable to open "./bibfiles.invf.dict"

The collection is in "."

                Files required by mgquery
bibfiles.text                      :   903.14 Kb       Inf%
bibfiles.invf                      :   405.40 Kb       Inf%
bibfiles.text.idx.wgt              :   115.95 Kb       Inf%
bibfiles.weight.approx             :    10.89 Kb       Inf%
bibfiles.invf.dict.blocked         :   560.83 Kb       Inf%
bibfiles.text.dict.fast            :   246.36 Kb       Inf%
SUB TOTAL                          :  2242.57 Kb       Inf%

                Files NOT required by mgquery
SUB TOTAL                          :     0.00 Kb       NaN%

TOTAL                              :  2242.57 Kb       Inf%

Notice the Infinities and NaNs in the last column!

(6) Although I have not done so, I think that the SEE ALSO sections in
all but mg.1 should reference ONLY the programs that are mentioned in
that particular man page file, with mg.1 preserving a reference to all
of them.
