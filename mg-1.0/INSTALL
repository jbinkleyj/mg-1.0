                     BUILDING AND INSTALLATION OF MG
                     ===============================
 
This file explains how to build the mg system.
 
(1) Type one of the following
        make solaris    # for solaris 2.X
        make sunos      # for SunOS 4.1.X
        make mips
        make hp         # for HP-PA machines !!!! Not working yet
 
(2) Included with mg is an X11 interface to mgquery called xmg. 
    Xmg is a ``wish'' script which uses the Tcl/Tk packages available
    by anonymous ftp from allspice.berkeley.edu [128.32.150.27].
 
(3) You will need to set the environment variable MGDATA which 
    indicates where the mg data files will be created. You will also
    need to create the directory you specify.
 
    e.g.
        setenv MGDATA ~/mgdata
	mkdir ~/mgdata
 
(4) You may also need to set the environment variable MGSAMPLE which 
    is used by mg_get and indicates where the sample data included 
    with this package is located.
    If this is not specified it defaults to ``./SampleData''
 
(5) Another environment variable that you may wish to set is
    MGIMAGEVIEWER, this variable sets the image viewer to be used
    to display images. The image viewer must take the image from stdin.
    If this is not specified it defaults to ``xv -''.
 
(6) To save typing, it is probably sensible to create a symlink from mg
    to the directory mg-1.0.
 
(7) Include mg-1.0/man (or mg/man) in your MANPATH environment variable.
 
(8) Include mg-1.0/bin (or mg/bin) in you path.
 
(9) After ``make''ing the package you can delete everything in 
    mg-1.0/mg, mg-1.0/src, mg-1.0/lib  and mg-1.0/include as desired,
    as they are not required for mg to run. If you don't want to use
    the sample data then everything in mg-1.0/SampleData can also be
    deleted.
